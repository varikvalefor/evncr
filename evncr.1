.Sh NAME
.Nm evncr
.Nd read stdin in the voice of EVAN DOORBELL
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm evncr
.Sh DESCRIPTION
EVANNOUNCER, otherwise known as
.Nm ,
is a program which reads STDIN clearly and enjoyably.

.Nm
adheres to the UNIX philosophy and is created by VARIK VALEFOR, with EVAN DOORBELL supplying the voice of
.Nm .

.Nm
can read passwords, UIDs, or essentially any form of text data which is of a reasonable length.

.Sh EXAMPLE
Running
.Sy echo asshat | evncr
should make the terminal speaker output
.Qq LATIN MINUSCULE ALFA, LATIN MINUSCULE SIERRA, LATIN MINUSCULE SIERRA, LATIN MINUSCULE HOTEL, LATIN MINUSCULE ALFA, LATIN MINUSCULE TANGO
in the voice of EVAN DOORBELL.
.Sh FILES
The
.Pa sounds
directory contains the audio files which are played by
.Nm
when reading sequences.  With the exception of pseudocharacters which are unique to
.Nm ,
e.g.,
.Qq LATIN
and
.Qq MINUSCULE ,
for all printable ASCII characters, the file which contains a character is named
.Sy [ASCII integer representation of character].wav .
However, majuscule and minuscule characters share source files, with the phrases
.Qq MAJUSCULE
and
.Qq MINUSCULE
being stored in individual files.  By using this approach, a few bytes can be saved.
The specifics of the conversion process can be gleaned from the functions which are called by
.Va parseCharacter .

On UNIX-based systems, the
.Pa sounds
folder is located in
.Pa /usr/local/share/evncr/ ,
and on Windows systems, the
.Pa sounds
folder is located in
.Pa [host drive]:\\\\Program Files\\\\EVANNOUNCER\\\\.
.Sh NOTES
As a result of using
.Sy mplayer
as the method of playing sounds, a functional
.Sy mplayer
installation is required.

EVAN's voice samples have not yet been provided.

Support for different inflections has not yet been implemented.

The current cross-platform solution for
.Nm
supports only UNIX-like operating systems.

.Sh HISTORY
The development of the first version of
.Nm
began on 20200709 and lasted two (2) days.
This
.Nm
was abandoned because this
.Nm
was terribly messy and unmaintainable.

The previous version of
.Nm
is written in C++ and is a bit unwieldy.  The source code of this implementation is available at
.Lk http://github.com/varikvalefor/evncr the EVANNOUNCER GitHub repository .

This version of
.Nm
is written in Haskell and was created because functionality could not be added to the previous version of
.Nm .
.Sh THANKS
EVAN is a cool dude and supplied the audio files of
.Nm
on a pro-bono basis.
.Pp
This willingness to assist the creation of this silly
program is
.Sy very much
appreciated.

This section is placed at the end of this document only for the sake of
following tradition.  A big
.Qq THANKS, MAN
would be cool, though.
.Sh CONTACT
Hate mail regarding
.Nm
can be sent to VARIK
